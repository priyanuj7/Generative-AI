These include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and LLaMA; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora. Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.\\nGenerative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and product design.

Intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\nSince its inception, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automations has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet\\'s automaton created in the early 1800s. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic artificial intelligence ===\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Artificial Intelligence research began in the 1950s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) and the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI. Since the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\\n\\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning used both discriminative models and generative models, to mode'"

      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'dUYRdW6fYTk'}, page_content=\"look at this fire number so you will need 12 and2 crores what happened why you laughing okay anyway we'll see no it is possible I'll tell you why because how many mutual funds do you have 25 what see actually Shar see he has recommended 25 different mutual funds for you which is definitely bad advice so that is your asset current asset allocation this is what it looks like did you know this looking ising nice actually XL magic so total you have 1 lakh 62,000 rupees available for investing every single month I thought that is not at all possible actually okay so these are all your goals now let us put the amount that you require for each of these goals what is this gold 40 lakh gold is not enough you want more gold I want a bigger car so all people are suggesting not to go for a bigger car what is the smart decision to do now the mistake that people make over here that that also is possible yes right so remember that time you were laughing when you saw the number 12 and half grows we mathematically proved it that it is possible if you this is mind [Music] going hey guys Welcome to our brand new series the personal CFO where I will be analyzing and dissecting financial problems of real life people of the one person Club so that I can help them achieve their financial needs on today's Maiden episode we have finny from Chennai finny thank you so much for coming to the first episode of the personal CFO how are you doing today yeah I'm perfect I'm terrific thank you very much Sharon for no no thank you thank you for agreeing to do this and when I saw your um uh financial situation at was very interesting there's a lot of things that we will be covering today so let us begin let us Begin finy by first understanding who you are so can you tell us a little bit about what do you do and you know where you from just tell me that in like a minute or so sure sure see I am uh 37 37 years old okay I'm working as a global rewards and people analytics partner in MNC this is I'm working with a company called FL Smith FL Smith Simmons and uh predominantly uh I was working as executive assistant the most of my career and I got switched to HR and uh uh within the four period uh time I got several promotions and I got a career switch as well and uh now uh now it is safe and my wife is also working as a business analyst in a company called pivotal Technologies which is an US based startup so now we are okay we don't have have any Debs fantastic we do have two children okay you have two children as well two children fantastic and you've been in Chennai your whole life yeah yeah yeah fantastic and you've been working for almost I would say 15 years so far 15 years of career yes yes [Music] fantastic cool so let's get started so I am presenting the master financial planner tool in front of you uh you would have already received this for being a member of the 1% Club you already have this right yes yes I do have it fantastic fantastic so we'll start off with the cash flow sheet uh so let's start off with what is the post tax salary uh that the entire household makes and I'm assuming that you and your wife are investing together right for all your financial goals so let us combine both your income and let's see what is the post tax salary that both of you are making on a monthly basis sure post tax salary is 286,000 rupees all right now let's come to your expenses so now the reason why we're doing this is that we need to understand exactly what is the Surplus money that you have right because only then you can start your investing Journey but I hope you've done the calculation that's why you come on this call today so what is your total monthly expenses yeah so it is close to 1 lak 120,000 uh Sharon so total monthly expenditure is 1 L 120,000 can you tell us the break up of this expenditure see the rental uh itself is uh somewhere close to 30,000 3 bhk it's in the prime prime location only 3bhk house 20,000 rent in Chennai 30,000 rent in chenai that is actually very very affordable like in Bangalore you said Prime area right Bangalore 3 BK would be like 50,000 Prime area so rent is rent is 30,000 what is the remaining 90,000 going into school fees we will be putting it aside 20,000 rupees in Rd so whenever you have to pay the school fees you just remove it from the Rd and pay the fees exactly exactly okay so house rent maintenance EB will be somewhere around 5,000 5,000 odd electricity okay electricity bill is 5,000 rupees okay 5,000 rupees uh mobile will be somewhere around 2,500 rupees internet will be somewhere around 1,800 or so couple of mes we have for cooking and this one that will be 10,000 rupees car cleaning will be uh again some, rupees and we do have property in our hometown so we are paying a Watchman over there so that is 15,000 rupees yeah so similarly petrol charges medicines groceries uh vegetables fruits snacks all put together somewhere close to 50,000 fantastic what's surprising is that with this 1 lakh 120,000 you're also supporting the supporting three other families thank you so any any compulsory Investments that you have like a ulip or a chit fund do you have any compulsory Investments no no as of now I have not done that any any running loan emis no nothing oh no loans at all no loans no loans that is actually very very surprising to hear because most Indian households by now they would have at least had two loans running one would be home loan one would be car loan so we have zero loans so we will understand the story behind that little later any what is the insurance premiums that you are paying on a yearly basis 45,000 rupees for uh for myself family it is 50 lakh yes so that is about I would say 4,000 rupees a month so I'll just put 4,000 rupes a month over here so 1ak 24,000 is going out of your bank account every month and 286,000 is coming into your bank account every month of your whole family so total you have 1ak 62,000 rupees available for investing every single month that literally puts you in the top 1% of India already in terms of earning potential right right because you're able to save so much every month so that's a very very good news for us and one of the reasons why this is happening finy is because you have no loans and you're living in a very affordable City like Chennai right so your expenses are very very controlled for a family of four so good job on that so that is done we're done with the cash flow so good news we have 1ak 62,000 Rupees to invest every month now let us go to your net worth so in this net worth sh you can also put your liabilities but because you have no loans I'm going to going to put it all at zero so let us start off with your net worth by starting off with real estate right so you you don't own any house right now right I don't own any house but we do have a a land actually uh 2,400 ft of land in our native place which is currently valued about 16 to 20 lakhs maybe okay so that is your other real estate do you have any re investment no okay now let's come to your Equity investment uh let's start off with your direct stock portfolio do you own any direct stocks nothing all right okay now let's talk about your mutual funds so why don't you tell me your mutual fund Investments one by one sure so ICA Prudential large and midcap fund uh somewhere close to 32,000 okay I'm going to mark this as a multicap fund because it has multiple categories in this fund what is the investment amount 32,000 32,000 total value right current value current value is okay okay next moal midap F it's 1ak 64,800 okay parak flexi Cap Fund 23,000 okay so uh finny how many mutual funds do you have totally 25 what you have 25 different mutual funds see actually Shar I got uh to acquainted with one guy actually who a friend of my colleague Okay so so I got introduced to mutual fund only last year uh probably by May or so and uh I don't have any knowledge about this mutual fund then okay so but I got uh some cash which I need to invest or something like that so I I have done in my all through my career uh I have saved some fund so I completely invested everything just trusting him and uh after your this 1% Club membership only I got to know that we should not invest in this regular funds right okay so now I'm clueless see it is close to somewhere around 25 lakhs is just sitting and all the 25 lakhs is uh uh is in regular fund except for somewhere around which I started in index F actually so this person uh is a mutual fund distributor who you met last year and he kept on giving you different different funds whichever has highest commissions see the the thing with the mutual fund distributor is not it's not that they're bad the problem is because their incentive is aligned with giving you the highest commission product most of them end up doing the wrong thing and they give you like see he has recommended 25 different mutual funds for you which is definitely bad advice right you should not have more than five or six mutual funds in your portfolio total right so thankfully you have filled this data beforehand fin so I'm just going to copy paste this entire uh data over here wow look at that can you can you see the screen yeah these are all your mutual funds this is what 25 different mutual funds okay now the important thing is to look at the asset allocation within the mutual funds now according to me you should not have more than four or five categories maximum which is an index fund midcap fund small Cap Fund either a multicap or a flexi Cap Fund I will put that in the same bracket and the last one is elss only if there is a tax saving opportunity now here let us see what you have done we need to eliminate some because we've put some hybrid funds over here so balance Advantage fund I will remove because it's not an Equity Fund cool so totally you have 24 6436 invested in mutual funds now the interesting thing over here finny is to look at your asset allocation among these mutual funds what we can see over here clearly that 64% is in midcap 7% is in large cap 10% is in flexi and multic cap and 18% is in small cap so uh when you look at your asset allocation here in my opinion we are heavily invested into midcap almost 65% which is a lot now there are some thumb rules that I want you to follow depending on your age right you told me your age is how much 36 right yeah 36 36 so you fall into this age 30 to 45 age so you need to have 30% in large cap 20% in midcap 20% in small cap and 30% in flexi cap or multicap mutual funds MH so now let's talk about your running sips I think uh let me just take that data so I already have okay why did you stop sips you you only do lump some Investments see I have started there and I'm just still continuing that otherwise everything uh everything is Lum got it so now it is saying you don't have enough money over here that is because we've not put you know your financial goals yet so don't worry this will come only this will change once you fill your financial goals and that is the most important part of this video so guys if you've been watching until now please stick till the end because Fin's financial goals will finally come and we will marry his asset allocation with all his financial goals and then we'll know exactly how finny can fix his financial life so that is coming up very very soon so next let's go to us Equity do you have any us Investments no all right let's understand your debt Investments Debt M not loans meaning things like savings account fixed deposit alone is there Sami no let's start off with savings account you have any savings account Investments uh that is close to 7 lakhs 7 lakhs what is the bank name wait I do I have this data I think I have the data is it this uh yes exactly uh what about FD do you have any FD Investments no no no no nothing so this is correct no no cash cash I don't have I I will not carry cash okay debt funds huh that was the um what is that the BF balanced Advantage Funds right but you don't have any other debt funds no oh those are debt funds you said I I am not aware of that actually so this balance Advantage fund is actually like a hybrid fund right they have obviously they have both equity and uh debt I would say um do not invest in them um right now because you know um balance Advantage fund because they're investing both in equity and debt um the fund you know you might as well invest entirely into Equity or entirely into debt instead of combining the board so I would say um you know it becomes very difficult to track your Investments as well or what you can do is um you can if you want to continue investing in this fund you can allocate so you need to look at the fund fact sheet and see what percentage is in equity what percentage in debt and mention it in both the sheets okay right so here let's say the equity component let's say 50% so let's say for example I want to invest in this fund mhm let's say this has some Equity component as well yeah let me just put it over here so let us assume that it has 50% Equity 50% debt for Simplicity sake okay right so I will let's say 11 12,000 rupees so I'll put 6,000 rupees here and and this is also 12,000 so I'll put 6,000 rupes here the remaining 6,000 rupees I'll put in the debt sheet that same fund so I'll just copy paste it over here and government investment you said suan Sam right how much is that close to 7 lakh 60,000 760,000 yes uh it's 5,000 rupees per month I'm doing it right from my daughter's Point perfect perfect any any running sips in you know debt funds or anything nothing right no no nothing else okay but your SS so can you're doing a 5,000 rupees sip right yes perfect perfect so we've done this next let's go to Gold you have an investment in gold jewelry Sovereign Gold Bond digital gold anything no no other than the variabl how much is that jewelry it is close to 42 lakhs 42 lakhs of jewelry okay so that's done next cryptocurrencies do you invest in crypto no no okay any other Investments like ulip small cases anything else so that brings us to the end of our net worth sheet so now all this data that you filled right your real estate domestic Equity us Equity debt gold crypto all of this will come and sit over here yeah and has come over here right and total net worth what you have right now is 97 lakh 72,2 123 so you are just around 2.3 lakhs away from becoming a Cora Cora okay right did you know that I never knew this actually just two 2.3 lakhs so maybe maybe next month you'll become a kotti actually salary will come next month you'll be a kurot literally okay right so yeah you become a you became a Coty at the age of 36 fantastic now this is important what is your liquid assets if I remove let's say real estate you don't have you have one real estate investment which is uh 16 lakhs and also if you remove the jewelry see the shocking thing is uh finny that out of 97 lakhs 42 lakhs is variable jewelry yeah like almost 40% of your money is in jewelry right and that also I'm putting as I'm not considering it as liquid the reason being you will never sell them right those are your family heirloom right there's an emotional sentiment to it so I will you will not sell them so I cannot give you an investment plan considering that you can sell it now if you look at this this is your total asset summary look at this what does this say 43% in Gold 25% in equity and 16% is in real estate now if I remove the jewelry because I can't sell it then let's see what your asset because the difference between total asset summary and current investable asset allocation is that this is all your assets put together including the things that you will never sell these are the things that you can sell right like 16 lakhs that how that plot of land you can sell you don't have any emotional attachment to it right you are ready to sell it right is that correct yes yes absolutely so now if I look at your asset allocation 4 4% is in domestic equity which is the Indian stock market which includes mutual fund stocks and all of that around 29% is in that plot of land that you have and 27% is in debt right so that is your asset current asset allocation this is what it looks like did you know this this is what it looks like looking is looking nice actually yeah Excel magic cool now we need to understand what is the required asset allocation so the mistake that people make when it comes to investing that they invest all of it as one pot of money and they try to make it grow but that's the wrong way of doing it you need to divide that pot of money into different buckets what are those different buckets short-term goals medium-term goals and long-term goals so that is what you see over here on the Excel right now the thumb rule here comes in that anything that is less than 3 years 100% will go into debt anything that is medium- term that is 3 to 6 years 40% will go into Equity 60% will go into debt and anything that is longterm which is greater than 5 6 years like your retirement and kids education and all of that that will have 60% Equity 10% us Equity 15% debt which is FD or bonds of and then 5% in Gold 5% in crypto and 5% in real estate now this is you can make some changes over here depending on the kind of person that you are now I think you will not want to put in crypto so I'm going to make this zero yeah and I will move that 5% to debt instead mhm similarly are you somebody who likees likes to invest in real estate mutual funds or buying new plots of land because you're a real estate expert based on what I'm hearing from you the answer is no so again I'm going to remove that 5% and put it to Gold so this I would say is what your asset allocation will be for long-term goals now this data will flow into your financial goals now this is the most important part of the exercise over here because this is what makes you unique [Music] now let us look at your financial goals I already have that sheet with me okay all right let's walk through them one by one so first is emergency fund which you needed within as soon as possible then you have you're thinking of buying a home 7 years from now right that's your second priority and you're trying to save up for the home loan down payment then higher education whose higher education is this this is my higher education actually I'm trying to do PhD as well so wow you're planning to do a PhD and you're saving up for that yeah that uh is very commendable right so that's your third priority then fire which is your retirement number 15 years from now so which means by 51 you want to retire yes vacations every year you want to take obviously car down payment within half a year you want to save up for a car this is where I am I a little confused Sharon I want your input actually see I own a Hyundai i20 okay that has started giving me problems okay so I want a bigger car as well I like to drive basically I mean see it is like saving money is also important the same way I need to have what I want right of course of course see I 100% agree right so if you're feeling like your current Hyundai I 10 is not making you happy then obviously you need to upgrade right now now the mistake that people make over here that they don't know how much money they can even spend on a car right I'll tell you why because as human beings we all optimize for short-term goals right anything that is short-term we try to get that quickly if it's a let's say BMW you want to go on a Europe trip you want to buy the iPhone 16 for that we will readily spend money but we are not thinking that hey I need to also save up for my retirement I need to also save up for my kids education that if I don't start now then I'll not be able to achieve them so when it comes to car there is a rule called the 24 10 rule okay which basically means 20% of the car should be given as down payment of the loan so let's say you're buying a 10 lakh Car 2 lakh you need to give as down payment for the car loan the car loan should not be more than four years mhm and the Emi should not be more than 10% of your salary okay that is the rule so right now your salary is what 286,000 the whole family so your your Emi on the car should not be more than like 20 25,000 rupes a month so so okay so these are all your goals now let us put the amount that you require for each of these goals so there is obviously you want to buy electronic gadgets you want to get gold what is this gold longterm for your kids yeah the 40 lakh gold is not enough you want more gold see here it's it's a traditional thing actually in my family no no I I know I was just kidding I know you will have to buy it's fine then delin delin is your is my daughter is your daughter delin is dein's wedding dein's education mahan's whole okay your son Holy Communion which is 5 years from now then education again you saved mahad's wedding what is club membership what is this I just want to enroll in a club members for former retirement basis very interesting and luxury car 10 years from now this I'm assuming this is like a BMW Mercedes kind of a thing yes fair enough everybody needs to buy that in once in their life so now I will put the amount required so since you've already put that I will just put it over here copy paste boom so emergency fund 12 lakhs is what you need this I'm assuming you are assuming one lakh I need every month so you have taken sorry 2 lakhs you need every month uh but no right actually you need how much, yeah so 1 lak 120,000 into six no okay so how much is that 1 120,000 into six is 7.2 lakhs okay fine right so you don't need that much money you don't need to put 12 lakhs into emergency fund this much is enough your fire number amount required today is 3 cror can you tell me how you calculated your fire number 3 crores as per today's value how are you doing it I will tell you how to do it then you tell me if you've done it like that or not first you understand what is your desired monthly expenses as per today's money close to two lakhs 2 lakhs per month so you multiply that by 12 that is how much 24 lakhs mhm so yearly you need 24 lakhs correct now the thumb rule stays that you need to have 25 times of this okay so what is 24 into 25 what is that number six crores right so you need six crores today M if you want to achieve if you want to have fire so as per today's value you need six crores not three crores so vacations you want 6 lakhs you want to spend on vacations every year yeah okay uh car down payment 5 lakhs okay all of this looks fine gold 90 lakhs delphins wedding 30 lakhs okay there's a lot of things to do luxury car 1 CR Mercedes eClass yes sir okay all right now let us put the goal inflation for Simplicity purpose I'm putting 5% inflation for all of them except for a few like things like luxury car inflates faster so I'm going to take 7% uh wedding also inflates faster 7% uh education inflates very fast 9% wedding another 7% and uh vacation also inflates faster usually 9% you know flights and all increase quickly higher education 9% cool so these are your number so look at this these are the amount required that you that you need in the future okay you see this look at this number you need 6 CR today but you're not retiring today you're retiring 15 years later so you will need 12 and a half crores what happened you need 12 and a half cres I know it looks difficult but we'll get there because what you're laughing is there okay anyway we'll see no it is possible I'll tell you why because you are able to save how much uh 1.6 lakhs every month that's a big number right and over 15 years let's see what happens because you're forgetting that your salar is also keep going to get keep getting incremented right and you have opted for a very luxurious lifestyle firstly 2 lakhs per month spending is not a normal lifestyle it's a luxurious lifestyle right so obviously the numbers will be this absurd now now the the good part is you've not considered your current Investments yet so there's more to be put so now you have total of 55 lakhs available with you where is this 55 lakhs coming from it's coming from your net worth sheet got it so now now this 55 lakhs will be divided across these various goals mhm now we we have to do it as per this order of [Music] priority okay so this car is a priority right now I mean the the change of car is a priority right now so how much I need to change uh that needs to be calculated other than that you have it no you have if it's a priority then you can go and get it no five lakhs you have you have it you can go and get it which car do you want actually I was thinking of getting a safari or something which is which is somewhere close to 25 lakhs this is what you want to buy 25 lakh car yeah okay all right so let's do this so you saying 25 lakh car if you put 5 lakh down payment so that's 20 lakhs of loan that you have to take correct and the interest rates is usually like 8% on the car and and I said what not more than 4 years years yes so that's about 48,000 rupees of monthly Emi ah that is 25,000 is what yeah you cannot put more than 25,000 rupees so then you you'll be forced to take a longer tenure of loan that which goes against the rule like if you have to talk like a 7ear loan but then it comes to 31,000 rupees now you have the question in front front of you you are you comfortable putting 10% of your monthly income towards a car loan Emi when you when we both of us know that you need to save 12 crores for your fire number that is the decision in front of your head yes yeah so this is the mistake that people make they're like okay I have money I'll buy this car but they're not considering their long-term goal allocation so find a car which is fitting in that budget 25,000 rupees per month right so let us do one thing see in my opinion the fire number is one of the most highest priority according to me so let us see how much money do you need to save to per month for hitting your fire number right so firstly 6 CR needing 12 half crores so let us allocate let's say 20 lakhs is going towards your Fire H is allocated for that so that brings it down to 11.6 crores required in the future you saw what happened if you started from zero you need 12 and 1 half crores more but if you allocate that 20 lakhs today of your existing money all of a sudden you you reduce it by 1 CR correct right so now you need 11 and a half crores let us assume that your salary increases by 10% every year now let us see what is the Sip required the Step Up sip for that you will use you can go to our website 1ers club. and go to the tool section and here you come to the SIP tool this is what it looks like so here you select your this is a trial and error right how much do you need how much did we say you need 11 11.5 cres you need 11.5 crores so let us assume you're starting a 1 lakh sip every month and you're increasing it by 10% every year expected return 12% and you have 15 years right for your fire yes so that is coming to 8.3 CR okay right now you have two options either delay your retirement or or increase your monthly sip or increase your monthly sip so what do you want to do increase my monthly sap we need to keep keep that as 12% only considering 15 years of uh this one that cannot be made to 15% for anything you you can but we're looking at post tax returns over here so see I can make it 14% also right but what if the market is down towards the end of 3 4 years there is a crash or a correction so that is the risk that we all take then it becomes 9 and a half crores you still need another couple of crores so let us say I make this 1 lakh 10,000 sorry 1 lakh 10,000 so this is how much this also won't work m 1 lakh 120,000 then you get 11.5 cres okay you see yeah toward reement I need to keep keep aside lak 12,000 rupees every month correct and you have to increase it by 10 then you have to increase it by 10% every year also right so remember that time you are laughing when you saw the number 12 and half cres right now we mathematically proved it that it is possible if you are investing 1ak 120,000 rupees every month and increase it by 10% every year for the next 15 years you will have 12 and a half crores yeah right but the assumption that we made is that you've taken a 14% return which is quite aggressive but let us do it for now right maybe sometimes you can increase your maybe for all we know you can sometimes you might get a big increment or a big promotion and your salary increases tremendously right so then you can contribute you can maybe increase your sip faster than 10% in some years understood right so that is also a possibility right so that is done how much is left you 42,000 left now let's figure out your other important goals I think you need to prioritize your um your daughter's education and marriage yes let's figure that out okay so let us allocate some money there right away and then there is also your gold as well which is a lot so I think gold we have 28 lakhs left let's put 10 lakhs each here 10 lakhs here also we'll put put like 10 lakhs how much do you have left you have 850,000 left here also we'll put 10 lakhs see see you went above budget you don't have this money yet so you have to put how much you have to put 8 lakh 52,000 223 now it has become perfect cool so what have you done out of your 55 lakhs existing networ worth investable net worth 20 lakhs has gone towards your retirement 10 lakhs has gone for your daughter's wedding um 10 lakhs for your daughter's gold for her wedding and then 8 lakh 52,000 for your son's wedding in the future now when you do all of that this is what's finally coming up these are the amount of money that you need now one by one we need to start calculating the Sip amounts required for all of these things right so let us do it one by one right see now you only have 42,000 rupees left to do yes um higher education is a must so let's start saving up for that and you only have what two years left for that 6 lakhs correct so let us save up for that since it's 2 years I can only assume 6% post tax return and 2 years left how much is that your making around 5 5.5 lakhs so that is enough so that's 20,000 rupes going here then what do you need vacations I would deprioritize for now you need to save up for your daughter's wedding and education right so education is coming in another five years right so that's what I need to concentrate on it right now delins education yes so that's 38 lakhs or 40 LH so what will you do here 40 lakhs you need in the next 5 years 5 years why is it 40 lakhs what kind of education is this see actually 40 lakh may not be required actually a whole just in case is going into an engineering it is a whole for the all four years I am calculating but it may not be required on the first year itself H so why don't you think of taking an education loan for that that also is possible yes yeah because I think vedding see Education Loans are cheap but wedding loans are not cheap I don't want you to be in a situation where you're forced to take a loan for your daughter's wedding that's the worst thing you can do very expensive loans education loan has tax benefits also so it's better to take education loan than to take a wedding loan right so let us do delins wedding first we need 35 lakhs in the next 12 years so let's see what happens I didn't think of this way Sharon thanks for this actually yes so um how many years 12 years right 12 years right for uh wedding yes yeah 12 years yeah so if you start 10,000 rupes sip right now increase it by 10% every year and since it's long-term goal let's assume that you can get a 14% return then it become 54 lakh so you can invest lesser let's say 34 lakh so 6,000 rupes if you do it's enough here for your delin wedding so that is done fantastic and yeah you're also doing Suk Sami right for that is going towards what what is that allocated for Suk Sami so you're doing a 5,000 rupees sip into Suk Sami you are allocating it for her education or for her wedding because you can do it for both we can do it for wedding only no wedding only okay so then then you don't need to put so much then even putting uh 3,000 is fine here M because will come around 8% around 8% you will get 7 and a half 8% okay so what is the Quantum uh that you put 5,000 rupees no yes so you are putting 5,000 rupes right now 7.6 lakh is already there right so yeah let's do one thing let's allocate this 7.6 lakh is already part of Suk Sami so what are we seeing here we have allocated already uh 10 lakhs okay makees sense remaining amount you need is 35 lakhs 35 and a half lakhs okay right and you're already doing a 5,000 rupees monthly sip into Su Sam for the next 12 years so how much will that number come you're asking me right let me just do it for you one second let me just show it here only here you're not increasing the Sip so just 5,000 rupees per month and let's say you're getting 7.5 and there's no tax here and in 12 years you will end up with almost 11 and a half lakh rupees no tax for this okay 11 and a half lakhs is coming from here so you need another 20 around 20 lakhs then to come from your other Investments so let's say that is coming through Step Up sip 12 years 14% if I do 3,000 rupe 3,500 rupees that is coming up to 1920 so 3,500 Rupees is enough for this okay so let's do 3,500 rupees all right what is it looking like you still have 19,000 18,500 rupes left that's good news now let's look at your Holy Communion of Mahan yes that that is also important so that's 12.8 lakhs you need in the next 5 years so let's say what is this 5 years if it if it's just 5 years then I will not assume more than 8% return and um close 10,000 yeah how much how how much did you need you needed 12.76 lakhs so you'll need to put more sorry 13,000 yeah 13 14,000 rupees if you put you will have that money okay okay that's all I have right now now how much is left you have another 4 and half th000 rupees left where will you put this um let's do one thing let's do this wedding right this wedding uh coming after 20 years only yeah correct so 56 lakhs is there so let's say how much is that amount that you have 4,500,000 4,500 rupees and if I increase it by 10% that's coming up to 1 CR how much did you need you need only 56 lakhs so you don't even need to put so much H so let's say 2,000 2,500 yeah perfect that's 2,500 rupees gone there so that's perfect um 2,000 rups is left maybe we will just see you also want to go for vacations but you need what you want this 7 lakh 6 and half lakh rupees you want to spend this every year I don't think you can I don't I don't maybe three years once or so at least we can do so then then let's make this goal three years no okay so then you have three years and then 6 lakhs you want to spend every 3 years this is like one international vacation right yes yes so the remaining money you have is 2,000 Rupees and how many 3 years ler 3 years expected return don't expect more than 6% you increase it by 10% it barely comes to 87,000 rupees so what I would do if I were you let's compromise on your fire right now see because I don't want you to feel like I can't go on vacation just to save for my retirement that is a stupid way of living life right so we will uh reduce this right we will reduce this and then put that 10,000 rupees has freed up right mhm so let us say you what happen happens when you do it 12,000 rupees then you're getting about 5 lakh rupees 5 lakh rupees every 3 years you will get for vacations okay that looks good right yes cool so this is the exercise that we just did to know exactly how much money you'll be investing into different different financial goals what can be done what cannot be done so how do you how do you feel after doing this exercise do you feel like you're now in control of what's happening with your yeah definitely this this is very very helpful Sharon actually so I exactly know see this exactly for the 2,500 milence wetting after coming I mean I thought that is not at all possible actually but by just quing 2,500 rupes every every month it will serve the purpose of 56 lakhs after 20 years that is a that is a good thing and it is very very comfortable for me absolutely this is mindblowing this is mind yeah that was that was that shocked me also how that small amount became 56 lakh right I hope now you are in more in control finny and you know exactly what to do [Music] next what we have done is what is the amount that she have right now and uh we have allocated those numbers inside this so just in case if I want to achieve all the numbers all the numbers in my goals to the mark what is the number that I want to keep as a goal uh is there any way that I can uh find that number so what you have to do is you need to calculate the you need to calculate the Sip amount for all the goals so whatever exercise we did by going to this sip calculator tool correct so you need to fill up the Sip amounts for all the goals okay which are still pending and then this this number will tell you what is the extra money that you needed to save okay fine fine f fine in terms of the car if I am allocating all the cash to that car I cannot do that right now but 75,000 I would say for car no finny because it's such a big problem for you right now take a 100% car loan and don't spend too much on the car don't buy a car which is worth more than let's say 12 lakhs 12 lakhs should be your ultimate Budget on a car because if you take a 12 lakh car your Emi will be less than 20,000 25,000 r a month okay mhm right so you banks will give you 100% car loan okay right but the problem is that then your this will reduce your cash FL 25,000 25,000 will go away from this uh 1,000 will become lak 145,000 rupes and investment I need to compromise okay fine but by looking at what is happening in today's scenario in your life we have made this plan but this is an exercise that is not completed once you have to do this every year because every year your life changes your income increases your expenses change your goals change this is what a financial plan to do that's what we call that personal CFO make sense fine fine fine cool finny happy I hope you have got you have cleared all your doubts you are in a much better Financial State now yes yes yes absolutely absolutely thank you very much Sharon this is mindblowing exercise that I have done I would have not done sitting alone actually so it helped me a lot thank you very much and that's the whole point and thank you for sharing the story with us so that more people get inspired by

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'e14UnK9FRxM'}, page_content=\"in today's video I need to explain to  you why net worth explodes after 100K so  let me show you the math first and then  I'll show you what you need to do so  let's start with this  demonstration so what if I give you a  choice I'll give you two offers and then  you tell me which one that you would  rather take offer number one I will give  you a million dollars right now and  offer number two I will give you a penny  right now and every day for 30 days I  will double your money so which offer  would you take offer number one provides  you with $1 million and here's what  offer number two provides you with so on  the first day you start off with a penny  and on the second day you have two cents  day three 4 cents day four day five 6 7  8 9 10 so your first 10 days are very  boring and then it speeds up so take a  look at day 11 day 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  19 20 and these last 10 days it gets  very exciting on day 21 you're at  $1,486 day 22 day 23 day 24 25 26  27 day 28 you're over a million dollar  day 29 and day 30  if you chose option number two you would  end up with over $5 million that is the  power of compounding now please pay  attention to this part because you will  get it why your net worth explodes after  100K so look at how slow the progress  was the first few days day one you one  penny day two 2 cents day three 4 cents  Etc after 10 days you have about $5 you  know that's nothing but then the growth  starts to meaningfully accelerate so  look at the next 10 days starting off  with day  11 and then it's really the next 10 days  where the money just explodes higher I  mean look at these amounts look at the  growth rate it gets very wild now in  this analogy getting your net worth to  100K is like getting to day 20 the first  part of your journey is slow and boring  and It's a Grind but then after that it  starts to really  Skyrocket that's because your money is  making you money and because with a  larger quantity of money you will make  more money so this is why it's so easy  for rich people to stay rich and this is  why it's so important for you to get  your net worth to 100K as quickly as  possible so that demonstration showed  you the power of compounding now I want  to show you compounding in action when  it comes to your net worth I will show  you the math so that you can witness the  numbers for yourself and you'll  understand why this is so important  and we'll use round numbers to make  things easier so let's say you're able  to save $10,000 each year to invest and  let's say that you're able to get a rate  of return of 10% a year so in your first  year you save up $10,000 and you invest  it on let's just say December 31st so  you end the year with  10K in year two that 10K will make you  $11,000 and you save an additional  $10,000 for that year so you end the  year with  $21,000 so in year three you now have  more money making you money and you save  another 10K and you end the year with  $33,135  6,410 year five 6 7 and so on now  getting to your first 100,000  will take you8 years getting to your  next $100,000 will take you four years  your next $100,000 will take you 3 years  so what's going on here again it speeds  up the process of making more money  becomes easier because your money is  making you money and it's a vicious  cycle in a good way so once you get here  year 24 to 25 your net worth will  increase by ,000 in one year once you  get here year 25 to 26 your net worth  will increase by $100,000 in less than  one year so that's the power of  compounding okay so what's the lesson  here well I would say there are a lot of  lessons here it's easier to make money  when you have money rich people have an  unfair Advantage compounding is the  eighth wonder of the world so yes those  are all correct  answers however the lesson that is most  important for you is that you need to  get your net worth to $100,000 as  quickly as possible so that your net  worth can explode higher so the longer  that you drag getting there then you are  delaying your wealth explosion if you  never get there then you will never  experience this wealth explosion but  what's the problem let's keep it real  the problem is how are you supposed to  get $100,000  so listen you're not going to magically  come up with $100,000 in one year at  least most people will not it's going to  take you years but remember that getting  your first 100K will be your hardest  100K and here's a truth that you must  realize the majority of your first 100K  will come from money that you work for  and saved up so looking back to our  previous example look at the math for  your first 100K of net worth about 7  72,000 of that came from you working and  saving that up now with that being said  I must tell you this if your net worth  is less than  $100,000 that is why it's so important  to save every dollar that you can  because the quicker that you can get to  100K the sooner you will see your net  worth start to  skyrockets so you'll already know what  you need to do you need to live within  your means you need to spend less than  you make so it's just a matter of you  having the discipline to  execute and you also already know this  this is just a reminder that you will  need to make sacrifices to save up your  first 100K so will making sacrifices be  fun and pleasurable so no of course not  but it will be short-term pain for  long-term gain so Charlie Munger who is  Warren Buffett's right-hand man said and  I quote the first 100K is a [ __ ] but  you got to do it I don't care what you  have to do find a way to get your hands  on 100,000 and I must tell you this  because so many people overlook this at  the end of the day you're trying to  spend less than you make right so that  you have money left over to save and  invest and most people overly focus on  cutting back their spending so yes  that's important but so many people  neglect the income part of the equation  you must also seek to increase your  income because there are only so many  expenses that you can cut especially  these days with the cost of living being  so outrageously High because of  inflation so many people are only  spending on Essentials and still there's  nothing left over at the end of the day  to save and invest so there's nothing  left to cut is what I'm saying so don't  neglect growing your income so I have a  lot of videos and content on that topic  and my last piece of advice that I want  to share with you is to start investing  early even if you have little  money you have witnessed how the early  stages of investing and growth are slow  and boring right but that's just the way  it is the sooner you get started the  quicker you'll get through that boring  phase and the sooner you'll get to that  explosive growth so do it in a  retirement accounts do it in a stock  market account or brokerage accounts  just get started the earlier the better  so this is how people get rich trust the  math trust the process now if you want  my opinion on what I would do if I'm  trying to get my net worth to 100K I'll  give you my strategy this is what I  would  do so I would take a two-pronged  approach so number one I would invest  money in the stock market so I would  look for every advantage that I could  get so I would do so in a retirement  accounts if your employer offers you a  match on your 401k or 403 b or whatever  plan take advantage take advantage of  the tax benefits of taxfree growth as  well and I like the Roth IRA very much  so I've been very clear about that in my  previous videos I would invest my money  in index funds ETFs so mutual funds so I  would keep it simple I would keep  contributing money each paycheck and  just set it and forget it and number two  the other thing that I would do is save  money for a down payment to buy a home  home so this is under assumption that  you found an area that you want to  settle down in so basically you will use  the leverage and inflation to your  advantage so let me give you an example  let's say that you can save $40,000 to  place a down payment on a $400,000 home  so listen I know that you're going to  pay PMI if you can't put down 20% but  not everyone has that luxury so if you  can you know good for you  now with $440,000 you have an asset  that's worth  400k if home prices inflat by 10% then  your home just went up in value by  $440,000 from 400k to  440 now as you're saving money for a  down payment I would put my money in a  high yielding savings  account so currently at the time of  making this video it's easy to get a  savings account that pays 4% to 5%  interest and I would make sure that my  money that I'm saving is in a reputable  financial  institution so stay away from  unreputable Shady Banks like yat bank  that decided to become an online casino  so yes the one that Graham Stefan  promoted so that's my advice let me know  what you think so listen I want to end  with this message I want to see you get  wealthy I want to see you get  financially free and no it's not going  to be easy yes it's a very difficult  process but I'm rooting for you thank  you so much and wish you a very nice day  take care\")]"

offer number two provides you with so on  the first day you start off with a penny  and on the second day you have two cents  day three 4 cents day four day five 6 7  8 9 10 so your first 10 days are very  boring and then it speeds up so take a  look at day 11 day 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  19 20 and these last 10 days it gets  very exciting on day 21 you're at  $1,486 day 22 day 23 day 24 25 26  27 day 28 you're over a million dollar  day 29 and day 30  if you chose option number two you would  end up with over $5 million that is the  power of compounding now please pay  attention to this part because you will  get it why your net worth explodes after  100K so look at how slow the progress  was the first few days day one you one  penny day two 2 cents day three 4 cents  Etc after 10 days you have about $5 you  know that's nothing but then the growth  starts to meaningfully accelerate so  look at the next 10 days starting off  with day  11 and then it's really the next 10 days  where the money just explodes higher I  mean look at these amounts look at the  growth rate it gets very wild now in  this analogy getting your net worth to  100K is like getting to day 20 the first  part of your journey is slow and boring  and It's a Grind but then after that it  starts to really  Skyrocket that's because your money is  making you money and because with a  larger quantity of money you will make  more money so this is why it's so easy  for rich people to stay rich and this is  why it's so important for you to get  your net worth to 100K as quickly as  possible so that demonstration showed  you the power of compounding now I want  to show you compounding in action when  it comes to your net worth I will show  you the math so that you can witness the  numbers for yourself and you'll  understand why this is so important  and we'll use round numbers to make  things easier so let's say you're able  to save $10,000 each year to invest and  let's say that you're able to get a rate  of return of 10% a year so in your first  year you save up $10,000 and you invest  it on let's just say December 31st so  you end the year with  10K in year two that 10K will make you  $11,000 and you save an additional  $10,000 for that year so you end the  year with  $21,000 so in year three you now have  more money making you money and you save  another 10K and you end the year with  $33,135  6,410 year five 6 7 and so on now  getting to your first 100,000  will take you8 years getting to your  next $100,000 will take you four years  your next $100,000 will take you 3 years  so what's going on here again it speeds  up the process of making more money  becomes easier because your money is  making you money and it's a vicious  cycle in a good way so once you get here  year 24 to 25 your net worth will  increase by ,000 in one year once you  get here year 25 to 26 your net worth  will increase by $100,000 in less than  one year so that's the power of  compounding okay so what's the lesson  here well I would say there are a lot of  lessons here it's easier to make money  when you have money rich people have an  unfair Advantage compounding is the  eighth wonder of the world so yes those  are all correct  answers however the lesson that is most  important for you is that you need to  get your net worth to $100,000 as  quickly as possible so that your net  worth can explode higher so the longer  that you drag getting there then you are  delaying your wealth explosion if you  never get there then you will never  experience this wealth explosion but  what's the problem let's keep it real  the problem is how are you supposed to  get $100,000  so listen you're not going to magically  come up with $100,000 in one year at  least most people will not it's going to  take you years but remember that getting  your first 100K will be your hardest  100K and here's a truth that you must  realize the majority of your first 100K  will come from money that you work for  and saved up so looking back to our  previous example look at the math for  your first 100K of net worth about 7  72,000 of that came from you working and  saving that up now with that being said  I must tell you this if your net worth  is less than  $100,000 that is why it's so important  to save every dollar that you can  because the quicker that you can get to  100K the sooner you will see your net  worth start to  skyrockets so you\n"
